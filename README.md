# CertifyNotifications

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/certify_notifications`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This is a thin wrapper for the [Certify Notifications API](https://github.com/SBA-ONE/notifications-api) to handle basic GET and POST operations for both conversations/threads and notifications.

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

All work on this gem is being done on the `develop` branch.
